# Goal
- High DPS (Damage Per Second)
- Defeat high Tier Dungeon (Tier 70+)
- Aim at Unstoppable Enemy and Boss

# Priority
Lucky Hit > Critical Strike
1. Lucky Hit is to **trigger** tons of Effects
2. Critical Strike is to improve **Damage**

# Concept
Ice Shards is great for building high DPS
- Ice Shards hits **5 or more** times per cast and calculate separately
- Easy to **trigger** Lucky Hit and Critical Strike

DPS = Gain Ã· Cost
- Gain (Damage, Crowd Control, Defense)
  - Improve Damage for per hit as much as possible
  - **Integrate** Crowd Control and Defense
  - The **faster** Skill casting, the higher the DPS
- Cost (Time, Mana)
  - **No cost** for Crowd Control and Defense
  - When consuming Mana, Mana must also be generated simultaneously

# Gear
Compatible with [Wand + Focus] or [Staff]  
But I suggest using **Wand + Focus**  
Focus with appropriate Affixes can provide **better performance**  
Staff can deal a **huge Damage** in a short time
