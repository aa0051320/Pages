# Goal
- High DPS (Damage Per Second)
- Defeat high Tier Dungeon (Tier 70+)
- Aim at Unstoppable Enemy and Boss

# Priority
Skill > Gear > Paragon
1. Skill and Gear work together
2. Paragon is compatible and flexible

Lucky Hit > Critical Strike > Crowd Control
1. Lucky Hit is to **trigger** tons of Effects
2. Critical Strike is to improve **Damage**
3. Crowd Control does not work for Unstoppable Enemy and Boss in most time

# Concept
Ice Shards is great for building high DPS
- Ice Shards hits **5 or more** times per cast and calculate separately
- Easy to **trigger** Lucky Hit and Critical Strike

DPS = Gain Ã· Cost
- Gain (Damage, Crowd Control, Defense)
  - Improve Damage for per hit as much as possible
  - **Integrate** Crowd Control and Defense
  - The **faster** Skill casting, the higher the DPS
- Cost (Time, Mana)
  - **No cost** for Crowd Control and Defense
  - When consuming Mana, Mana must also be generated simultaneously

# Skill
Active Skills
   - Frost Bolt (Trigger)
     - Frigid Breeze (**Mana**)
   - Ice Shards (**Vulnerable**)
   - Unstable Currents (**Attack Speed**)

Enchantment
  - Fire Bolt (Trigger)
    - Devouring Blaze (**Damage**)
  - Ball Lightning (Trigger, Damage)
    - Coursing Currents (**Critical Strike**)
    - Electrocution (**Defense**)
    - Convulsions (**Stun**)

Passive Skills (Flexible)

# Gear
I suggest using **Wand + Focus**  
Focus with appropriate Affixes can provide **better performance**

> I did a comparison test for using **Staff**  
> Although Staff can provide a huge Damage in a short time  
> But the **shortcoming** is less Lucky Hit, Mana, Critical Strike, Crowd Control, Attack Speed, etc.

<!-- # Gear
I recommend using **Staff**.

In high Tier Dungeon, enemies are often Unstoppable.  
Crowd Control is not so useful.  
The faster you kill enemies, the safer you are.

Staff has +100% Effect.  
As long as the Affixes of Staff is properly chosen, it can deal huge Damage to Unstoppable Enemy and Boss.  
But the prerequisite is that **Lucky Hit Chance** must be high enough so that Mana can keep up with Attack Speed. -->
