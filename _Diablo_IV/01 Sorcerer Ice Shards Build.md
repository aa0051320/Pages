# Goal
- Higher DPS (Damage Per Second)
- Defeat higher and higher Tier Dungeon

# Priority
Skill > Gear > Paragon
1. Skill is the most basic playstyle
2. Gear is based on playstyle
3. Paragon has good compatibility and flexibility

# Skill
Based on my research, **Ice Shards** is great for building high DPS.  
Ice Shards hits 5 times and calculated separately for each hit.  
There is more than 5 times chance to trigger Lucky Hit or Critical Strike in 1 cast.  

## Stats Explanation

|   Mana Generation   | Skill-related, Generate by Skill |
