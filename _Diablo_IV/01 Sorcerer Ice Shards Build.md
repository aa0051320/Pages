# Goal
- Higher DPS (Damage Per Second)
- Defeat higher Tier Dungeon

# Priority
Skill > Gear > Paragon
1. Skill is the most basic playstyle
2. Gear is based on playstyle
3. Paragon is compatible and flexible

Lucky Hit > Critical Strike
1. Lucky Hit is to trigger tons of **Effects**
2. Critical Strike is to improve **Damage** and trigger Effects

# Concept
Based on my research, **Ice Shards** is great for building high DPS.
- Ice Shards hits 5 or more times per cast, and each hit calculate separately.
- Easy to trigger Lucky Hit and Critical Strike.

DPS = ( Damage + Defense ) Ã· Time
- Damage
  - Improve Damage for per hit as much as possible
  - Integrate **Crowd Control**
- Defense
  - Integrate **Passive Defense**
- Time
  - Don't wait for **Mana Regeneration**
  - Don't wait for **Cooldown**
  - Don't cost any time or Mana for **Crowd Control**
  - When consuming Mana, Mana must also be **generated simultaneously**
  - The **faster** Skill casting, the higher the DPS

# Skill
Active Skills
   1. Frost Bolt (Mana)
   2. Ice Shards (**Vulnerable**)
      - Enchantment: Fire Bolt (Trigger)
        - Devouring Blaze (**Damage**)
      - Enchantment: Ball Lightning (Trigger)
        - Electrocution (**Defense**)
        - Convulsions (**Stun**)
   3. Unstable Currents (Attack Speed)

Passive Skills (Flexible)

# Gear
I suggest using **Wand + Focus**.  
According to my Affixes, Focus can provide **better performance** for whole build.  
Easier to keep you **safe**. 

> I tested some fine-tune for using Staff.  
> Although Staff can provide a huge Damage in a short time.  
> But Staff is hard to let Mana keep up with Attack Speed for lasting DPS.  
> This make Staff hard to defeat higher Tier Dungeon.
