# Goal
- High DPS (Damage Per Second)
- Defeat high Tier Dungeon
- Target on BOSS, Elite and Unstoppable Enemy

# Priority
Skill > Gear > Paragon
1. Skill is the most basic playstyle
2. Gear is based on playstyle
3. Paragon is compatible and flexible

Lucky Hit > Critical Strike > Crowd Control
1. Lucky Hit is to **trigger** tons of Effects
2. Critical Strike is to improve **Damage**
3. Crowd Control does not work for BOSS, Elite or Unstoppable Enemy in most time

Intelligence > Dexterity > Willpower > All Stats > Strength

# Concept
Ice Shards is great for building high DPS
- Ice Shards hits **5 or more** times per cast and calculate separately
- Easy to **trigger** Lucky Hit and Critical Strike

DPS = Damage Ã· Time
- Damage
  - Improve Damage for per hit as much as possible
  - Integrate Crowd Control
- Time
  - Don't wait for Mana Regeneration
  - Don't wait for Cooldown
  - Don't cost any time or Mana for Crowd Control
  - When consuming Mana, Mana must also be generated simultaneously
  - The faster Skill casting, the higher the DPS

# Skill
Active Skills
   - Frost Bolt (Mana)
   - Ice Shards (Vulnerable)
   - Unstable Currents (Attack Speed)

Enchantment
  - Frost Bolt (**Chill**)
  - Fire Bolt (Trigger) -> Devouring Blaze (**Damage**)

Passive Skills (Flexible)

# Gear (Wand)
I suggest using **Wand + Focus**.  
According to my Affixes, Focus can provide **better performance** for whole build.  
Easier to keep you **safe**. 

> I tested some fine-tune for using Staff.  
> Although Staff can provide a huge Damage in a short time.  
> But Staff is hard to let Mana keep up with Attack Speed for lasting DPS.  
> This make Staff hard to defeat high Tier Dungeon.

# Gear (Staff)
In high Tier Dungeon, enemies are often unstoppable.  
Crowd Control is not so useful.  
The faster you kill enemies, the safer you are.  
Staff has +100% Effect. As long as the Affixes of Staff is properly chosen, it can deal huge Damage to BOSS, Elite or Unstoppable Enemy.

## Gear Affixes Priority
1. Attack Speed
2. Lucky Hit Chance
3. Lucky Hit Chance while You Have a Barrier
